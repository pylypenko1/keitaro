                The Company does not guarantee the value, quality, compatibility or any other feature of the Third
                Parties, Products or any other information provided, consumed or otherwise made available (hereinafter

                under the sole responsibility of the applicable Third Party or User using it, as applicable, or using

                be decided in accordance with its sole discretion, as described in these Terms. You understand and agree
                that you may be exposed to content or other information that is inaccurate, objectionable, inappropriate

                responsible for the conduct of third parties, including any Users, whether online or offline, and
                operators of external sites.
            </p>
            <p>
                In no event shall the Company or any of its officers, directors, employees, or agents be liable to you
                for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive, or consequential damages, arising out of or in
                connection with your use of the Website or Services,
                whether or not the damages are foreseeable and whether or not the Company has been advised of the
                possibility of such damages. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply to the fullest extent
                permitted by law in the applicable jurisdiction.

                proceedings, assertions, damages, costs, liabilities or expenses (including court costs and reasonable
                attorneys’ legal fees) which the Company may suffer or
                incur in connection with any actual claim, demand, action or other proceeding by any third party arising
                from or relating to any breach of these Terms by you or any use by you of the Website or Services not in
                accordance with applicable
                law.
            </p>
            <h2>12. Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>
                These&nbsp;Terms&nbsp;shall be governed by the laws of England, exclusive of its choice of law rules,
                and without regard to the United Nations Convention on the International Sales of Goods. Your conduct
                may also be subject to other local, state, and
                national laws. Any dispute arising under these Terms or concerning the Website or Service shall be
                finally settled by the competent courts of England. You may not advance any class action claims against
                the Company, and by using the Website
                or Services you agree to waive your rights to advance any such class actions claims.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any cause of action against the Company must be brought within one (1) year of the date such cause of
                action arose. In the event that any provision of these&nbsp;Terms&nbsp;is held to be unenforceable, such
                provision shall be replaced with an enforceable
                provision which most closely achieves the effect of the original provision, and the remaining terms of
                these Terms&nbsp;shall remain in full force and effect. Nothing in these Terms creates any agency,
                employment, joint venture, or partnership
                relationship between you and the Company or enables you to act on behalf of the Company. Except as may
                be expressly stated in these&nbsp;Terms, these&nbsp;Terms&nbsp;constitute the entire agreement between
                the Company and you pertaining
                to the subject matter hereof.
            </p>
            <p>
                Any notices that we may be required to provide to you, whether under law or according to these Terms,
                may be provided by the Company to any contact information you have provided in your Account information
                or other, either directly or indirectly, including
                through email. You expressly agree to the receipt of such communications and notices in such manner.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may not assign any rights hereunder without our prior written consent. Nothing contained in these
                Terms shall be construed to limit the actions or remedies available to the Company with respect to any
                prohibited activity or conduct. Non-enforcement
                of any term of these&nbsp;Terms&nbsp;does not constitute consent or waiver, and the Company reserves the
                right to enforce such term at its sole discretion. No waiver of any breach or default hereunder shall be
                deemed to be a waiver of
                any preceding or subsequent breach or default.

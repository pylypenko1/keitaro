            <p>The Bitcoin market is full of potential, even for new investors. With the right tools, knowledge and

            <p>We at Immediate Edge test the market and use a comprehensive system that connects traders with brokers
                that are active globally. As explained earlier, you’ll be able to trade a variety of cryptocurrencies
                like Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar, Chainlink and many others with the click of a mouse.
            </p>
            <p>But there are also possibilities to trade regular assets like gold and silver and/or regular currencies
                like USD, GBP, EUR, and dozens of others. It’s your call!</p>

            <p>Carefully selected brokers will provide you with a legit auto trading platform that can execute trades at
                lightning speed so you won't lose time. The best part is that a professional advisor from the broker's
                firm will call you to explain everything in really simple language.</p>
            <p>You’ll learn precisely about their systems, pricing, risks, tips and tricks. For example, you’ll be able
                to implement a stop-loss system that could potentially limit your exposure to major losses. Getting

                    <div class="faqAnswer">
                        <p>We at Immediate Edge review the crypto market to give you the best opportunity to access the
                            top BROKER in your country.</p>
                        <ul>

                                reliable and beginner-friendly.</li>
                            <li>You don't need to be rich to get started. A minimum initial investment of $250 is
                                enough.</li>
                            <li>You can access your trading tools on both desktop and mobile. Ongoing support is also

                        <p>Experienced traders can use Immediate Edge to access more advanced tools. Most brokers we
                            work with offer the opportunity to trade CFDs with leverage. These are complex trading tools
                            that could increase your potential profit. However, use such tools only when you gain enough
                            experience. Trading involves risk, and trading with leverage could result in losing your
                            entire investment.</p>

                        <p>Our platform is exceptionally beginner-friendly as you only need to enter your details. After
                            that's done, your info will be sent to a broker who will offer you several trading services.
                            Some, or even all of their services, can be highly lucrative, but due to the volatility of
                            the markets, that can also be extremely risky. So never spend more than you can afford. If
                            you're not sure what you are getting into, please consult a licensed professional advisor
                            before engaging in any trading activities. Most beginners lose their capital when using
                            complex instruments such as CFDs, trading robots, and automation tools. So always do your
                            due diligence and be aware of the risks involved in trading.</p>

                        <p>Unfortunately, we can't give any personal investment advice. However, generally speaking,
                            many experts believe it's a smart move to allocate a small part of your portfolio into
                            cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin; let's say 2 to 8% of your savings. Especially now, since the
                            banks globally keep lowering their interest rates! With that being said, cryptocurrency and
                            leveraged trading can be extremely risky. You could lose your entire investment quite
                            easily. So ONLY invest what you can afford to lose. Make sure it's not your only source of
                            income, and don't invest in assets you don't understand.</p>

                            That said, before you start trading, it's always smart to do your own due diligence. Read a

                <h3>High-Risk Investment Warning</h3>
                <p>Immediate Edge acts as a marketing tool to attract investors and connect them with reputable brokers.
                    In return, we get compensated by our affiliated partners. Note that we are not an auto trading
                    platform. We are not brokers or financial advisors. The content above is educational and should not

                    activity or using any automated system.</p>
                <p>Trading is highly risky, and you should not speculate with borrowed money or money you can't afford
                    to lose. You may lose more money than you've invested. Make sure you understand the nature of CFDs
                    before you start trading.</p>
                <p>Moreover, it's your obligation to make sure that your use of this website complies with any law,

                    due to the financial risks involved. We do not encourage the promotion of CFDs based on crypto
                    assets in the UK either, and we prevent clients from the UK or the US from using Immediate Edge.

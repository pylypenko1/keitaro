            <p>This Cookie Policy explains how ("Company", "we", "us", and "our") use cookies and similar technologies, <span class="domaintextname-qzFIkwQD"></span>, to recognize you when you visit our website located at <span class="domaintextname-qzFIkwQD"></span> ("Website"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to control their use.</p>

            <p>In some cases, we may use cookies to collect personal information, or that becomes personal information if we combine it with other information.</p>

            <h3>What are cookies?</h3>

            <p>Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website. Cookies are widely used by website owners to make their websites work or work more efficiently, as well as to provide reporting information.</p>

            <p>Cookies set by the website owner, <span class="domaintextname-qzFIkwQD"></span> (in this case ), are called "first-party cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g., advertising, interactive content, and analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and when it visits certain other websites.</p>

            <h3>Why do we use cookies?</h3>

            <p>We use first-party and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons for our website to operate, and we refer to them as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies. Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our online properties. Third parties use cookies through our Website for advertising, analytics, and other purposes. More details are provided below.</p>

            <h3>How can I control cookies?</h3>

            <p>You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie preferences by setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Manager. The Cookie Consent Manager allows you to select which categories of cookies you accept or reject. Essential cookies cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.</p>

            <p>The Cookie Consent Manager can be found in the cookie consent banner and on our website. If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or refuse cookies.</p>

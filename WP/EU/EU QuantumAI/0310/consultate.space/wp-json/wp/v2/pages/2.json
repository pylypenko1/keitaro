The first computer around the 20th century was not capable of performing computations on its own, while nowadays pocket-sized pieces of technology can instantly and accurately solve complex problems (given the right inputs and sets of instructions).<br>Computers and their physical parts have been constantly optimized in terms of performance, speed and size, but we are reaching the point where the only way to pack more computational power in them is to work at atomic levels. This unlocks both incredible potential and great challenges.<br>Quantum Computing is a new kind of computing based on Quantum mechanics, that uses subatomic particles (e.g. atoms, electrons, photons) as bits and exploits their probabilistic nature. They can solve any problem that a classical computer can, and vice-versa. But quantum computers can solve such problems in reasonably and exponentially lower time complexities (\u201cQuantum Supremacy\u201d). This exponential speedup is a game-changer in the field of machine learning, where the performance of the models is often tied to the size of the training dataset and the time allotted to the training process. The more data and time are given to a model, the better the results. Nowadays, models are often trained on smaller sets of data because of time constraints, but a Quantum Machine Learning model would allow us to train models on larger datasets without taking exponential time.<\/p>\n<\/div><\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Organized by Objective This summer school aims to provide both an objective and clear overview and an in-depth analysis of the state-of-the-art research in Quantum Machine Learning and Quantum AI.The courses will be delivered by world renowned experts in the field, from both academia and industry, and will cover both theoretical and practical aspects of [&hellip;]<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":95,"parent":0,"menu_order":0,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","template":"templates\/template-cover.php","meta":{"_mi_skip_tracking":false},"_links":{"self":[{"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2"}],"collection":[{"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages"}],"about":[{"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/page"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/1"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=2"}],"version-history":[{"count":95,"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2\/revisions"}],"predecessor-version":[{"id":792,"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/pages\/2\/revisions\/792"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/95"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"http:\/\/eqai.eu\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=2"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}

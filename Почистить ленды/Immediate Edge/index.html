          <p><b><i>Online trading is becoming a very popular way to execute buy-and-sell transactions of cryptocurrencies, contracts for difference (CFD), assets, and other currencies. Online trading has been around since 1971, when the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) became the first software that started online trading.</i></b></p>
          <p>As the years passed, there have been several changes to the online trading platforms; there are now hundreds of different assets that you can exchange, markets that you can invest in, and revolutionary software that makes the trading process smoother for you.</p>
          <p>To make your trading experience easier, we gathered as much information as we could on trading strategies and put it into developing the official Immediate Edge app, which is now available to all our members! This software was designed for people who want a smoother trading experience, whether they’re beginners or experienced users.</p>

          <h2 class="title">How Does Online Trading Work?</h2>
          <p><b><i>Online trading has a basic premise, but it’s more complex in execution. In essence, it involves executing buy/sell orders through the internet. You can trade a wide variety of assets, such as CFDs, commodities, bonds, currencies, cryptocurrencies, and many more.</i></b></p>
          <p>To start trading on the internet, all you need is a computer and a stable internet connection. After you create your trading account, you can start buying or selling assets whenever you want.</p>
          <p>However, trading isn’t as easy as it seems. This activity involves a lot of risks, planning, and trial-and-error. When it comes to trading assets online, some of them may be highly volatile. When you begin trading, you need to involve practicing, studying market data, and preparing new and improved trading strategies.</p>
          <p>With the constant growth of trading over the past few years, modern trading software was created with the intention of making that process even easier. Traditional trading is hard to master, and not everybody has enough time to dedicate to that. Thanks to these new pieces of software, beginners can start trading without many issues.</p>

          <h2 class="title">How Does Immediate Edge Work?</h2>
          <p><b><i>This is the official Immediate Edge app! Its main purpose is to help you trade more smoothly and fluently. We understand that getting into trading may not be as straightforward to everyone, which is why we created this software to make it easier to understand for any type of user.</i></b></p>
          <p>To use Immediate Edge, you first have to set up your trading parameters (if you don’t know how to set these parameters, the app provides an easy-to-understand setup process). After you do this, the app is going to study market data until it finds a potential good trading opportunity for you. Depending on how you set up the app, it can notify you about this potential trading opportunity.</p>
          <p>There are several advantages of using Immediate Edge. However, the best thing about it is that it can save you a huge amount of time studying market data and looking for trading opportunities yourself. This type of traditional trading can be too stressful for beginners, which is why we’re providing a tool that can help you trade more effectively.</p>
          <p>Keep in mind that this app can be used by users of every skill level. If you’re a beginner, you can use the app to learn the fundamentals of trading and have a more fluent start. On the other hand, if you’re an advanced user, you can still use the app to save time on your trades.</p>

          <p><b><i>Whether you’re a beginner, intermediate, or advanced user, there are many ways to get the most out of Immediate Edge. First, you need to understand how trading apps can be more efficient than traditional trading.</i></b></p>
          <p>Since online trading became a trend, it was something stressful for most people. This is because there’s little to no margin of error; the slightest mistake could cost you a high amount of money, which is discouraging for newcomers. While many people have made peace with the fact that trading is always going to involve some ups and downs, other people feel like they’re wasting all their deposit on these trades.</p>
          <p>As you get more skilled, your trading methods could significantly increase with your ability to make trades on your own without the software, but there’s not a precise method to do it; you have to keep practicing and studying.</p>
          <p>Immediate Edge can take most of that stress away. Most of the stress factor comes from constantly monitoring market data to find a good trade for you. Trading apps monitor the market data for you, leaving you with a stress-free experience.</p>
          <p>Overall, these features work great for beginners since it takes the stress and frustration out of the equation, but they’re also good for advanced users who want to save time on their daily trading.</p>

            <div class="benefit-text">
              <p>Many trading platforms on the internet charge you additional fees for using said platform. This means that from each withdrawal you make, that company takes a small percentage, leaving you with a portion of what you earned. While this is not a bad thing, we understand that most users want to keep 100% of their earnings.</p>
              <p>All the potential earnings you make with Immediate Edge are yours; we don’t take any percentages from the withdrawal process, so you don’t have to worry about that. However, keep in mind that depending on your bank institution, you may have to pay a small amount to receive your money. To make sure of this, we recommend that you contact your bank and ask for its withdrawal fees.</p>

            <div class="benefit-text">
              <p>One of the main things that we wanted to address with Immediate Edge was compatibility. Most professional traders use a powerful computer to keep track of the latest trading trends and find good trading opportunities. However, your trading could also be more efficient if you could access your account from anywhere.</p>
              <p>Immediate Edge can be used from any device that has a stable internet connection and browser. This means that you can use your computer or laptop as your “main device” for trading, but you can still access the app from your phone or tablet whenever you go outside your home. This can help you keep track of everything, even if you’re not at home.</p>

            <div class="benefit-text">
              <p>You can use Immediate Edge to trade any type of asset you feel most comfortable with. Not every trader wants to buy or sell the same things, so we wanted to make sure that you could use the same app for everything.</p>
              <p>For example, if you mainly trade cryptocurrencies, you can use the app to make these types of trades. On the other hand, if you want to start trading a different kind of asset alongside cryptocurrencies, you can also do that.</p>
              <p>Remember that to be successful at trading, you need to stick to a particular trading plan from time to time; make sure that you’re not constantly changing strategies.</p>

        <b>Important Risk Note:</b> Trading can generate notable benefits; however, it also involves a risk of partial/full funds loss, and should be considered by initial investors. Around 70 percent of the investors will lose money. Carefully read our terms & conditions and disclaimer page before investing. Customers must be cognizant of their individual capital gain tax liability in their country of residence.

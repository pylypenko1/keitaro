            <h3 class="faq-question light-purple bold h2" data-i18n>What is Bitcoin?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>A bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency. It is also often referred to as ‘virtual currency’ or ‘digital currency.’ In simple terms, a bitcoin is a type of money, but it does not have a central bank or administrator. Use this form of currency just as you would use any currency. You can use it to buy goods. Today, more and more merchants are selling their ware for both traditional money and bitcoins. More and more traders are now accepting bitcoin currency.</p>
            <p>To make a financial transaction with a bitcoin, send a complete bitcoin or a part of a bitcoin to other people. All details of a bitcoin transaction are stored carefully in a public listing known as a blockchain.</p>

            <h4 class="faq-question light-purple bold h2" data-i18n>What does a bitcoin look like?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>A bitcoin does not look like the average note or coin. But that does not mean it isn’t real or valuable.</p>
            <p>A bitcoin is a computer file that sits in a virtual or digital wallet app. This can be downloaded onto your smartphone or computer.</p>

            <h4 class="faq-question light-purple bold h2" data-i18n>What is the value of bitcoin?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>The value of a bitcoin is continuously changing. When bitcoins first made their appearance in the market in 2009, a single bitcoin was equal to less than $1. In March 2014, its worth had gone up to around $700. By December 2017, the worth of a bitcoin soared up to approximately $20,000. Today, a bitcoin is worth much more. By the end of 2021, your bitcoin could be worth $80,000. Because of the growing value of bitcoins, people can become more affluent, faster.</p>

            <h4 class="faq-question light-purple bold h2" data-i18n>How does bitcoin work?</h4>
            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>Consider bitcoins as individual blocks. You would treat these blocks as carefully as you would treat traditional money. When purchasing with bitcoins, the bitcoin transfers from the buyer (you) to the seller (the person whom you buy the good from). Bitcoins are extremely valuable because each bitcoin is worth several tens of thousands of dollars. Each bitcoin can be exchanged for a variety of real goods and services, and even for cash. All transactions are electronic transactions. Every individual transaction is verified via your system.</p>

              What is the advantage of bitcoins that traditional cash does not provide?
            </div>
            <p class="faq-answer">Bitcoins are stored more safely and securely than regular traditional cash.</p>
            <p>Bitcoins are a type of cryptocurrency that is legal in the United States of America.</p>
            <p>More and more merchants are offering to trade their wares for cryptocurrency. In other words, you can buy goods with bitcoins rather than with real money.</p>
            <p>Bitcoins are worth much more than traditional cash.</p>
            <p>Bitcoins are not controlled by the government or by any bank. So, people can remain anonymous regarding their bitcoin transactions and where they spend their virtual currency. It is impossible to tell which account number is yours – unless you explicitly tell someone.</p>
            <p>Every transaction is recorded and stored in a public repository. So, it is not possible to create fake coins, copy bitcoins, or conduct a spurious bitcoin transaction with someone else’s bitcoins.</p>

            <h2 class="faq-question light-purple bold" data-i18n>Can anyone use the Bitcoin Era software? Should I have experience in trading?</h2>
            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>The Bitcoin Era software is so easy to use that anyone can use it. Seasoned traders and new traders can use the app. If you are new to trading apps, you have nothing to fear because now you can trade Bitcoins safely and profitably.</p>
            <p>The updated version of the Bitcoin Era has multiple new customizable features. That means setting up your trading parameters is so much simpler. The app is so self-explanatory that you won’t have any difficulty using the app.</p>
            <p>If you are an expert trader, you can make use of Bitcoin Era to test your success at trading analysis and strategies. You can even improve your accuracy in the trading markets before making money.</p>
            <p>With the Bitcoin Era app, you have full control of your trading activities if you use the ‘manual’ mode. Or you can choose the “automated” style, let the software find the best trades, and invest in those on your behalf.</p>

            <h3 class="faq-question light-purple bold h2" data-i18n>Is it complicated to trade on the app?</h3>
            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>No trading experience is required. No previous experience in using an app is needed. If you can operate your computer and your smartphone, you can easily use the Bitcoin Era App. Rather than buying/selling Bitcoin from an exchange, what you will be doing is trading Bitcoin CFDs (Contracts for Differences). All you must do is make a pure guess (as accurately as possible) or speculate (as accurately as possible) on the price of Bitcoin. You can make money as and when the price of Bitcoin moves up or down.</p>

            <p class="faq-answer" data-i18n>Bitcoin Era is a comprehensive automated trading software exclusively designed to trade in the Bitcoin market. This software has won several awards, thanks to its advanced algorithm that can assess various markets and find the most rewarding trading opportunities. The Bitcoin Era algorithm compares massive amounts of previous and existing data and applies the fundamental and technical analysis of the existing market conditions.</p>
            <p>The advanced design of the Bitcoin Era software’s algorithm ensures that it analyses the markets with high accuracy. It has the advantage of knowing when the markets will move and in which direction they will move. It is this absolute precision that makes Bitcoin Era work reliably and consistently.</p>
            <p>When on Bitcoin Era, you can customize the trading parameters of the software. That is, you can set:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>The types and kinds of assets you want to trade-in</li>
              <li>The amount you want to invest in</li>
              <li>Set the risk level</li>
              <li>Set the strategies you wish to use</li>
            </ul>
            <p>New traders or inexperienced traders prefer to take advantage of the “automated” mode. In the automated style, the software does all the heavy lifting. The Bitcoin Era software searches for a trading opportunity that matches the trading parameters that you set. Once it does find a precise match, it automatically opens a trade-in your name.</p>
            <p>You can set the Bitcoin Era software to ‘manual’ mode if you want to have full control of your trading activities. That is what our experienced trading members do, as they prefer to have 100% control over their trading activity.</p>
            <p>You can choose whichever mode suits you.</p>
